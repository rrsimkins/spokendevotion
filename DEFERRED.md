## Confessions — DistroKid (pending)

**Open Hands**, **Receipts, Not Stages**, and **Wineglass on Concrete** still use hosted MP3 previews on `/confessions/` until uploaded to DistroKid. Remove MP3s and add pre-save / streaming cards when HyperFollow links are ready.

## Formspark Contact Form

Contact form uses Formspark + Cloudflare Turnstile. Form ID and Turnstile site key are in `partials/contact-config.js`. Turnstile **secret key** lives only in the Formspark dashboard. Notification email: `contact@spokendevotion.com`.

## Instrumental — Post-Release

*Resting in the Father I* is live on `/instrumental/` with pre-save and full tracklist. Nav Soon badge removed. After June 28, 2026 release, add streaming player embed.

## YouTube Migration for Audio

Prayer section: Prayer for Family, Prayer of Repentance, and Prayer of Need use YouTube embeds; remaining album tracks stream via DistroKid July 3, 2026. Worship and Reflections singles have no hosted MP3s on the site (pre-save only). Confessions still use hosted MP3s until DistroKid upload. Instrumental album has no hosted MP3s on the site (pre-save only).

## Banner Image Optimization

All section banners are in place (`main`, `bible`, `confession`, `instrumental`, `prayer`, `reflections`, `worship`). Optional: compress large PNGs (e.g. `instrumental.png`, `worship.png`) for faster loads.
