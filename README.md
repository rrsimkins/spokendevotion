# Spoken Devotion

**Words that heal, lift, and draw us closer to God.**

A family creative project sharing spoken poetry, worship, prayer, and Scripture — focused on emotional strength and honoring Christ and God the Father.

## Who We Are

Spoken Devotion is **not** a church, charity, or official ministry. We are ordinary working people who love God, creating and sharing personal devotion in our spare time. We do **not** ask for donations and are not seeking support, recognition, or reward — we simply want to share God's love freely.

If something here moves you and you feel stirred to give, we gently invite you to turn that generosity toward someone near you: a neighbor in need, a friend carrying a burden, or a stranger who could use practical kindness. Let your gift become God's love made visible right where you live.

*Spoken Devotion LLC* holds copyright on our original content. The LLC is our legal entity for publishing; it does not change that this is a personal, freely shared creative work.
