# Spoken Devotion

**Words that heal, lift, and draw us closer to God.**

A ministry of spoken poetry, worship, prayer, and Scripture — focused on emotional strength and honoring Christ and God the Father.

## Our Mission

To create content that strengthens the heart, comforts the soul, and glorifies our Lord Jesus Christ. Through spoken words, we seek to provide emotional healing, spiritual encouragement, and a deeper connection with God the Father and His Son.

## Contact

Use the [Contact Us](https://spokendevotion.com/contact/) page — the form is ready for visitors; backend delivery is not wired up yet.

## Still To Do

See also [`DEFERRED.md`](DEFERRED.md) for the full backlog. Priority items for the next session:

- [ ] **Contact form backend** — connect `/contact/` form `action` to a webform service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.) so submissions reach `ruby@spokendevotion.com` without exposing the address on the site
- [ ] **Social media links** — homepage Connect section icons still point to `#`; add real TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, and YouTube profile URLs in `index.html`
- [ ] **Instrumental tracks** — add audio files and cards on `/instrumental/` when ready
- [ ] **YouTube migration** — move hosted MP3s to YouTube embeds instead of serving files from the repo
- [ ] **www DNS** — add CNAME for `www.spokendevotion.com` → `awsimkins.github.io`
- [ ] **Page banners** — add remaining banner images (`worship.png`, `prayer.png`, `confessions.png`, `bible.png`, `instrumental.png`) under `/images/`

## Vision

To create content that strengthens the heart, comforts the soul, and glorifies our Lord Jesus Christ through the power of spoken words.
